# 🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis using Power BI

A data storytelling project built on the iconic Titanic dataset to uncover the patterns behind passenger survival. This project demonstrates my end-to-end data analysis skills — from cleaning and transforming raw data to building an interactive Power BI dashboard with actionable insights.

## 📊 Tools & Techniques Used

- **Power BI** (Dashboard creation & DAX)
- **Power Query** (Data cleaning & transformation)
- **DAX Measures** (Age buckets, survival rates)
- **Data Visualization** (Cards, bar charts, pie charts, slicers)

## 🔍 Key Insights

- 💡 **Only 38.4%** of passengers survived the Titanic disaster.
- 👩 **Females (74.2%)** had a far higher survival rate than males (18.9%).
- 🧒 **Children aged 0–12** had the highest survival odds across all age groups.
- 🎟️ **1st Class passengers** had more than **2.5x survival rate** compared to 3rd Class.
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Medium-sized families (2–4 members)** were more likely to survive than individuals or large families.
- 🚫 **Big families in 3rd Class** had the lowest odds, with survival rates as low as **7.4%**.
- 🛳️ Port of Embarkation mattered — passengers from **Port C** had the highest survival rate.
- 📈 Combination of **Age + Class + Family Size** heavily influenced outcomes.
